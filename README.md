- 🔄 **Career Shift**: Transitioning to cybersecurity from graphic design, driven by the evolving landscape of **AI** and a desire to align with my IT background.

## 🔐 Current Focus
As a cybersecurity trainee, I'm working on building a strong foundation in network security, ethical hacking, and incident response. Some recent projects include:

1. **Techtalk Presentation**: Aiming to make cybersecurity accessible, I designed different beginner-friendly presentations to introduce basic concepts and best practices.

- [Windows ISO and Optimization](https://gamma.app/docs/Windows-ISOs-and-Optimization-A-Beginners-Guide-ofe4x1mqjli4xp5): A beginner's guide to Windows ISO management and optimization for improved system performance.
- [Ransomware: A Digital Threat](https://gamma.app/docs/Ransomware-A-Digital-Threat-mlnhh8f2myl1dke): An in-depth look at ransomware, its impact, and strategies for protection against this prevalent cybersecurity threat.

2. **Hackers Poulette Startup Project**:
   - Collaborating on a scalable network design for a startup led by CEO Robert Tappan Morris.
   - Ensuring network scalability and internet connectivity across all hosts.
  
3. **Network Design Project with Cisco Packet Tracer**:
   - Designing a secure, cost-effective network for a client moving into a new office.
   - Focus areas include DNS, DHCP, VLANs, ACLs, and iSCSI storage.
   - Employing VLAN trunking on aggregate switches for different departments.

4. **Shadowbrook Library Breach Analysis**:
   - Using **Wireshark** to investigate potential data exfiltration in network traffic logs.

## 📈 Skills & Tools
- **Networking**: DNS, DHCP, VLANs, ACLs, network segmentation, and iSCSI storage
